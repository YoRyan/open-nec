# Introduction

The Open NEC Project is a massive, work-in-progress systems overhaul mod for [Train Simulator 20xx](https://live.dovetailgames.com/live/train-simulator) that encompasses Amtrak's Northeast Corridor locale from Washington, DC to Boston. The mod is planned to include enhancements for all of the Amtrak, NJ Transit, Metro-North, and other equipment that Dovetail Games has released for the Northeast Corridor. It will also include upgrades for the signaling systems of the various routes.

To make this all possible, the project provides drop-in replacements for Dovetail's Lua bytecode. With control of the Lua scripting, we have complete control over the behavior of locomotive's systems, as well as the route's signaling system. Thus, we can fix bugs and make dramatic improvements to the gameplay experience.

Currently, the project consists of a single enhancement mod for several Amtrak locomotives, as well as complete Automatic Train Control (ATC) and Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) implementations.

Locomotives overhauled by the Open NEC project include:
