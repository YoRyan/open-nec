# NJ Transit North Jersey Coast and Morristown-Essex Lines

## Signaling

As far as I can tell, the signaling system implemented for the Philadelphia to New York Route was also reused for both of these routes.

## Speed Limits

Type 1 speed limits represent visible speed posts. Type 3 limits represent signal speeds. There are no type 2 limits.
