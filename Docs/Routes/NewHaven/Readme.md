# Northeast Corridor - New York to New Haven

This route covers the stretch of the Northeast Corridor from New York City to New Haven, Connecticut. It includes both Metro-North's New Haven Line out of Grand Central Terminal and Amtrak's main line out of Penn Station, which converge together at New Rochelle, New York. Dovetail developed two separate signal scripts for the Metro-North portion of the line (from Grand Central to New Haven via New Rochelle) and the Amtrak portion (from Penn Station to New Rochelle), a curious decision given that both railroads share the same Pennsylvania Railroad-derived pulse code signaling system in real life.

## Signaling

### Penn Station to New Rochelle

The signals on the Amtrak portion of the route send messages in the form of `sigN`, where N is a numeric code that communicates the aspect. The codes seem to be the same codes used by the Philadelphia to New York, North Jersey Coast Line, and Morristown-Essex Line renditions of the Northeast Corridor.
