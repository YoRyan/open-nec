# NJ Transit North Jersey Coast and Morristown-Essex Lines

## Signaling

As far as I can tell, the signaling system implemented for the [New York to Philadelphia](../northeastcorridor) route was also reused for both of these routes.

## Speed limits

Type 1 speed limits represent visible speed posts. Type 3 limits represent signal speeds. There are no type 2 limits.
