# Metro-North P32AC-DM

The GE P32AC-DM is a dual-mode electric and diesel locomotive that provides express service from Grand Central Terminal to Metro-North's various unelectrified branch lines.

Unfortunately, some of the P32's scenarios and quick drive consists incorrectly set the P32 for diesel mode at startupâ€”even when the scenario begins in Grand Central Terminal, or when the consist is labeled "Third Rail."

It's not clear how much horsepower is available to the P32 in electric mode. Intuitively, there would be less power available, since the locomotive's top speed in this mode is lower. One educated [guess](https://www.nyctransitforums.com/topic/22340-p32ac-dm-question/?tab=comments#comment-312459) by Fan Railer is 2200 hp, versus about 2900 hp in diesel mode (less HEP). However, another [source](https://www.trainsim.com/vbts/showthread.php?181917-P32AC-DM-Speed-Limits) claims the full power of the locomotive is available in electric mode, and that the top speed is limited only to avoid arcing the 3rd rail.

Metro-North [practice](https://www.reddit.com/r/nycrail/comments/f617cx/are_the_p32_ac_dm_locomotives_good_in_electric/fi2jp2z/) is to keep the P32 in diesel mode for as long as possible, which means switching to electric when entering the platforms at Grand Central and switching to diesel when exiting the Park Avenue Tunnel - contrary to Dovetail's manual (evidently copied from that of the M8), which suggests the changeover occurs at the end of the overhead catenary between Pelham and Mount Vernon East.
