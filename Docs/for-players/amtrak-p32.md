# Notes for the Amtrak P32AC-DM

The GE P32AC-DM is a dual-mode electric and diesel locomotive used by Amtrak for its Empire Service and Lake Shore Limited services. Open NEC equips the P32 with universal cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES.

### New features

- Press Ctrl+D to disable and enable ATC, and Ctrl+F to disable and enable ACSES. Both systems are turned on by default.
- The yellow overspeed number on the driving screen is now functional. It is used to display ACSES civil speed limits (as well as any signal speed limits above 45 mph). If you violate the displayed speed limit, this number will flash to draw your attention to it.
- A 20-second delay has been added for the switch between electric and diesel modes. During this time, the engine will produce no power.

### Errata

- The signal speed limit display on the center ADU cannot display signal speeds above 45 mph, so the yellow overspeed number is used to display these speeds.
