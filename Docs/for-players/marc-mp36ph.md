# Notes for the MARC MP36PH

The MPI MP36PH is a diesel locomotive included with the Washington to Baltimore route. As Dovetail Games was unable to obtain a MARC license, the locomotive is unbranded. It appears to be based on the Caltrain MP36PH model, with the addition of an Amtrak-style cab signaling display.

The Open NEC Project modifies the MP36PH to include functional cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES systems.
