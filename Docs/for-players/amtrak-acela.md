# Notes for the Amtrak Acela Express

The Acela Express is a high-speed electric trainset sold as a standalone addon to the New York to Philadelphia and New York to New Haven routes. Another version is distributed with the Washington to Baltimore route. As Amtrak's flagship Northeast Corridor train, the Acela is equipped with cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES.

### Mod compatibility

The Open NEC mod for the Acela is fully compatible and tested with Fan Railer's Acela physics and sound mod. *However*, Fan Railer's mod must be installed first. Otherwise, if Open NEC is installed first, then the Q key (which isn't mapped on the stock Acela either) will remain unmapped, and you will have to acknowledge the safety systems by clicking and dragging the 3D plunger or by clicking the exclamation mark on the HUD.

There is also a known bug with the June 4, 2020 version of Fan Railer's mod: The signal speed display on the ADU is unreadable. Although you can still read the current cab signal aspect, this means it is impossible to distinguish between the 60 mph and 80 mph cab speeds.

### Bugs fixed

- The Q key now operates the acknowledgement plunger.

### New features

- The original New York-Philadelphia destination signs have been replaced with new signs that cover every station stop on the Acela's route from Washington to Boston.
    - In addition, you may hold the destination selector to the left or to the right to continuously scroll through destinations.
- In addition to ATC and ACSES, an alerter has been installed.
- Press Ctrl+D to disable and enable ATC, and Ctrl+F to disable and enable ACSES. Both systems are turned on by default.

### Errata

- The signal speed limit display cannot display specific 100 mph, 125 mph, or 150 mph speeds. Instead, you can take the lack of a speed to mean "Clear, 125 mph." Currently, no Dovetail route can actually send 100 mph or 150 mph speed codes, but should these be implemented in the future, the track speed limit display will be used to communicate these speeds.
