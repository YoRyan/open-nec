# Notes for the NJ Transit Arrow III

The GE Arrow III is an electric multiple-unit operated by New Jersey Transit. Open NEC equips the Arrow with universal cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES.

### Mod compatibility

The Open NEC mod for the Arrow is fully compatible and tested with Fan Railer's physics and sound [mod](https://youtu.be/OUE-pSs3-eA).

### New features

- Press Ctrl+D to disable and enable ATC, and Ctrl+F to disable and enable ACSES. Both systems are turned on by default.
- In addition to ATC and ACSES, an alerter has been installed.
- AI trains now run with their lights lit properly.

### Errata

- The Arrow's ADU works a little differently compared to the ones present in other NJT locomotives. Dovetail Games did not program the green speed bar correctly; they set it to track the current speed, and this cannot be easily overridden by a mod. Open NEC therefore uses the *red* speed bar to show the maximum ATC/ACSES authorized speed.
