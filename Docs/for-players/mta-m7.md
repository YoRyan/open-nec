# Notes for the Metro-North M7

The Bombardier M7 is an electric multiple-unit that is operated by Metro-North and is included with the Hudson Line DLC. Open NEC equips the M7 with an improved ATC implementation that works more reliably and that is also compatible with all Amtrak and NJ Transit routes. The M7's cockpit model does not include any kind of variable speed limit display (just a four-aspect cab signal display), so the ACSES system is excluded.

### New features

- "Notches" have been added to the master controller for the minimum power, coast, minimum brake, and maximum brake settings. The controller will snap to one of these settings if it is within a nearby region.
