# Notes for the Metro-North Shoreliner Cab Car

The Bombardier Shoreliner III is a control car included with the Metro-North P32AC-DM standalone pack, and with the Hudson Line DLC. Open NEC equips the Shoreliner with an alerter and an improved ATC implementation that works more reliably and that is also compatible with all Amtrak and NJ Transit routes. The Shoreliner's cockpit model does not include any kind of variable speed limit display (just a four-aspect cab signal display), so the ACSES system is excluded.

### New features

- OpenNEC removes the automatic power changeover functions. When driving with a P32 at the rear, use the power mode switch inside the cockpit to change modes.
- Ditch lights no longer flash when sounding the horn.
