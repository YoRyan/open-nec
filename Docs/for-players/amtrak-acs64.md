# Notes for the Amtrak ACS-64

The Siemens ACS-64 is a high-speed electric locomotive included with the New York to New Haven and Washington to Baltimore routes. It currently hauls all of Amtrak's conventional trains on the Northeast Corridor.

### Mod compatibility

The Open NEC mod for the ACS-64 is fully compatible and tested with Fan Railer's ACS-64 physics and sound [mod](https://youtu.be/9bJzQIxGuXk). However, Fan Railer's mod must be installed *first* for the Open NEC scripting to function.

### New features

- Press Ctrl+D to disable and enable ATC, and Ctrl+F to disable and enable ACSES. Both systems are turned on by default. There is also an alerter that, if both ATC and ACSES are turned off, is also turned off.
