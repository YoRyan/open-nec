# Notes for the Metro-North P32AC-DM

The GE P32AC-DM is a dual-mode electric and diesel locomotive that provides express service from Grand Central Terminal to Metro-Njorth's various unelectrified branch lines. Open NEC equips the P32 universal with cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES.

### Mod compatibility

The Open NEC mod for the P32AC-DM is fully compatible and tested with Fan Railer's P32AC-DM/Shoreliner physics and sound [mod](https://youtu.be/vQJ_EhWAz0Y).

### New features

- Press Ctrl+D to disable and enable ATC, and Ctrl+F to disable and enable ACSES. Both systems are turned on by default.
- The yellow overspeed number on the driving screen is now functional. It is used to display ACSES civil speed limits (as well as any signal speed limits above 45 mph). If you violate the displayed speed limit, this number will flash to draw your attention to it.
- The Ctrl+Shift+A "advanced power mode" toggle has been removed. Instead, you have manual control of the locomotive's power mode at all times.
- A 20-second delay has been added for the switch between electric and diesel modes. During this time, the engine will produce no power.

### Errata

- Unfortunately, some of the P32's scenarios and quick drive consists incorrectly set the P32 for diesel mode at startupâ€”even when the scenario begins in Grand Central Terminal, or when the consist is labeled "Third Rail."
- The signal speed limit display on the center ADU cannot display signal speeds above 45 mph, so the yellow overspeed number is used to display these speeds.
