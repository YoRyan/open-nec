# Notes for the NJ Transit ALP-45DP

The Bombardier ALP-45DP is a dual-mode electric and diesel locomotive that provides one-seat rides between New York Penn Station and NJ Transit's various unelectrified branches. Open NEC equips the ALP-45DP with fully functional cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES.

### Mod compatibility

The Open NEC mod for the ALP-45DP is fully compatible and tested with Fan Railer's ALP-45DP/Comet physics and sound [mod](https://youtu.be/6S9HdpWjMho).

### New features

- Press Ctrl+D to disable and enable ATC, and Ctrl+F to disable and enable ACSES. Both systems are turned on by default.
- All power changeover aids have been removed. Instead, follow the procedures described in the manual to change power modes: Use the Fault Reset button to change from electric to diesel mode, and raise the pantograph to change from diesel to electric mode.
    - The train must be stopped and the throttle centered at zero to start the changeover process, which takes about 100 seconds to complete.
