# Notes for the MARC Multilevel Cab Car

The Bombardier Multilevel is a bilevel railcar included with the Washington to Baltimore route. As Dovetail Games was unable to obtain a MARC license, the coach is unbranded. It appears to be identical to the NJ Transit Multilevel model, to the point of including destination signs for NJ Transit stops.

The Open NEC Project modifies the Multilevel cab car to include functional cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES systems.
