# Notes for the NJ Transit GP40PH-2B

The EMD GP40-2B is a diesel locomotive used by NJ Transit. Open NEC equips the GP40 with fully functional cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES.

### Mod compatibility

The Open NEC mod for the GP40 is fully compatible and tested with Fan Railer's GP40PH-2B physics and sound [mod](https://youtu.be/ZZtyMVBdtE0).

### New features

- Press Ctrl+D to disable and enable ATC, and Ctrl+F to disable and enable ACSES. Both systems are turned on by default.
- In addition to ATC and ACSES, an alerter has been installed.

### Errata

- The extremely annoying safety systems alarm sound, which sounds suspiciously like a British AWS warning horn, has been replaced with the beep-beep sound found on other NJT equipment.
