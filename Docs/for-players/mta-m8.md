# Notes for the Metro-North M8

The Kawasaki M8 is a dual-mode electric multiple-unit operated by Metro-North. It operates on overhead power on the New Haven Line and third-rail power within the vicinity of Grand Central Terminal. Open NEC equips the M8 with universal cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES.

### Mod compatibility

The Open NEC mod for the M8 is fully compatible and tested with Fan Railer's M8 physics and sound [mod](https://youtu.be/WQzPOthQP08), but Fan Railer's mod must be installed *first* because it contains a script file that conflicts with the one supplied by Open NEC.

### New features

- Press Ctrl+D to disable and enable ATC, and Ctrl+F to disable and enable ACSES. Both systems are turned on by default.
- The automatic power change function using the P key, HUD, or Xbox controller has been removed. Instead, all pantograph controls now function as a simple power cutoff switch. To switch between power modes, you should use the in-cab "mode of operation" knob.
- A 10-second delay has been imposed for the power switch. During this time, the unit will produce no power, and the power indicators on the driving screen will be colored yellow.

### Errata

- The signal speed limit display on the center ADU cannot display signal speeds above 45 mph, so the track speed display is used to display these speeds.
