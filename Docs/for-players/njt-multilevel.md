# Notes for the NJ Transit/MARC Multilevel Cab Car

The Bombardier Multilevel is a bilevel railcar included with the New Jersey Transit North Jersey Coast Line and ALP-46 DLC's. An unbranded version, which serves as a stand-in for MARC equipment, is also included with the Washington to Baltimore route. Aside from sporting a new exterior texture, no further changes to the MARC version were made. In fact, it comes with the same destination signs as those of the NJ Transit version.

The Open NEC Project modifies the Multilevel cab car to include functional cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES systems.
