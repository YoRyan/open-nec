# Notes for the NJ Transit/MARC Multilevel Cab Car

The Bombardier Multilevel is a bilevel railcar included with the New Jersey Transit North Jersey Coast Line and ALP-46 DLC's. An unbranded version, which serves as a stand-in for MARC equipment, is also included with the Washington to Baltimore route. Aside from sporting a new exterior texture, Dovetail made no further changes to this MARC version. In fact, it comes with the same destination signs as those of the NJ Transit version.

The Open NEC Project modifies the Multilevel cab car to include functional cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES systems.

### New features

- For the MARC version, the destination signs have been retextured to show "MARC", "No Passengers", "Union Station", "Penn Station", "Martin State Airport", and "Perryville".
- Press Ctrl+D to disable and enable ATC, and Ctrl+F to disable and enable ACSES. Both systems are turned on by default. There is also an alerter that, if both ATC and ACSES are turned off, is also turned off.
