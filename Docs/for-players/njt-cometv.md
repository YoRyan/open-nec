# Notes for the NJ Transit Comet V Cab Car

The Bombardier Comet V is a railcar included with most New Jersey Transit DLC's. Because it is equipped with ACSES, it is the sole single-level cab car currently in use on the NJ Transit system.  The Open NEC Project modifies the Comet V to include functional cab signaling, ATC, and ACSES systems.

### New features

- Press Ctrl+D to disable and enable ATC, and Ctrl+F to disable and enable ACSES. Both systems are turned on by default. There is also an alerter that, if both ATC and ACSES are turned off, is also turned off.
- Use the crossing lights dial in the cab to change between off, fixed, and auto (flash for 30 seconds following the last horn blow) ditch light operation. The J hotkey toggles between the fixed and auto modes.
