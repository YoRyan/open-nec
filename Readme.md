# Open Northeast Corridor Project

The Open NEC Project is a massive systems overhaul mod for Northeast Corridor content for Train Simulator 20xx, in the style of the flight simulation community's [A32NX Project](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx). The objectives are to fix the control bugs, permit every locomotive to run on every route, and create as realistic an experience as possible.

## Current status

The following locomotives have been successfully overhauled:

- [Amtrak EMD AEM-7](https://store.steampowered.com/app/65232/Train_Simulator_Northeast_Corridor_New_York__Philadelphia_Route_AddOn/)
