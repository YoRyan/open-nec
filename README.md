# railworks-tstl-template

Write scripts for Train Simulator Classic in TypeScript with the help of [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/)! With TypeScript, you benefit from strong typing guarantees, modern tooling, and a vibrant community of users, which all add up to a vastly superior development experience compared to the Lua 5.0 ecosystem that Train Simulator ships with. It's like upgrading from a ðŸš‚ to a ðŸš….

This template includes type declarations and wrappers for Train Simulator's Lua API and a [functional reactive programming library](https://github.com/santoshrajan/frpjs) suitable for building engine scripts with.
